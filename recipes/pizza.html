<h2>Homemade Pizza</h2>
<p>This simple homemade pizza recipe is perfect for satisfying your pizza cravings. You can customize your toppings to suit your preferences, and the crust turns out crispy and delicious every time.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Pizza dough (store-bought or homemade)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>Toppings of your choice</li>
    <li>Olive oil (for brushing)</li>
    <li>Dried oregano and red pepper flakes (optional, for seasoning)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.</li>
        <li>Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface to your desired thickness. If you prefer a thin crust, roll it out thinner; for a thicker crust, keep it a bit thicker.</li>
        <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza peel or an inverted baking sheet that has been sprinkled with cornmeal or flour. This will make it easier to slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone in the oven.</li>
        <li>Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust. Use the back of a spoon to distribute the sauce.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle about half of the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce. This will help keep the toppings in place and create that classic cheesy layer.</li>
        <li>Add your choice of toppings. Get creative! Place sliced vegetables, meats, and any other toppings you prefer.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella cheese on top of the toppings.</li>
        <li>Drizzle a little olive oil over the pizza for a golden crust. You can also sprinkle some dried oregano and red pepper flakes for extra flavor.</li>
        <li>Carefully slide the pizza (on the peel or inverted baking sheet) onto the preheated pizza stone in the oven. If you don't have a pizza stone, simply place the pizza on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake for about 12-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown, and the cheese is bubbling and slightly browned.</li>
        <li>Using oven mitts, remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a minute or two. Then, transfer it to a cutting board, slice, and enjoy your homemade pizza!</li>
